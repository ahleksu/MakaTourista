Good Day Sir! 

We are the fifth group of I-ACDS composing of the following students:

[Macatuhay, Angel Kaye B.]
[Mantupar, Ma. Shielo E.]
[MiÃ±ao, Cedric Jeffrey B.]
[Ochoa, Carl Dominic T.]
[Pelayo, Christine Joy B.]
[Robles, John Alex Y.]

We would like to have you read this text file because there may be a possibility that once the HTML files were opened, it would look different. We haven't tested it for sure. But if it does happen, this may be due to the fonts we used. We picked fonts that had to be downloaded because these fit the theme of our website. The fonts are located at "css,fonts&images>fonts". 

Furthermore, there are some code that we didn't try to remove because if we remove it, it makes the whole site adjust. We tried to make the website responsive but in the end, it was just difficult for us to adjust everything due to its responsiveness. We left the code snippet so that it would not damage or manipulate other blocks of HTML code. 

We hope for your kind consideration Sir. Thank you and God bless. 
Merry Christmas po!!! :D :D 

Sincerely,
Group 5
